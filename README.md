# Hello, I'm Eric, an IT Project Coordinator, Help Desk Support and Enthusiastic Problem Solver

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about IT and how the field has evolved mainframes to personal computers, mobile devices, IoT, technologies like cloud computing, virtual machines, data science and AI. All this has triggered innovation in how we interact and collaborate using technology, but this has also exposed organisations, individuals and companies to a lot of secirity risk, hence my desire to graduate to the field of Cybersecurity.
